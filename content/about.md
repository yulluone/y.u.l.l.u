##### <span>01.</span> About me

I'm a skilled software engineer with experience in TypeScript, Javascript and Python, and expertise in frameworks like React, Vue, Node.js, NextJs, and Nuxt. I'm a quick learner and I collaborate closely with clients to create efficient, scalable, and user friendly solutions that solve real-world problems. Let's work together to bring your ideas to reality!

##### <span>02.</span> Interests and Hobbies

I enjoy building exciting and ambitious side projects that I never finish, traveling, discovering and exploring new places. I always have a comic or manga at hand for light reading. I am very competitive at table tennis and my favourite way to spend a sunny afternoon is at the swimming pool.

##### <span>03.</span> Framework Preferences

I am always trying out new frameworks and web technologies as they are released and updated but I find that I always go back to Next.js. React was my first love and nothing beats that first love.
