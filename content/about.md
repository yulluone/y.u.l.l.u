##### <span>01.</span> My Adventure

From as far back as I can recall, I've been fueled by curiosity. I'm that person who just has to figure out how things tick. Stuff breaks in my hands - I'm always pushing it to the limit, just to see what it can do. I always got in trouble but I've gotten way better at putting things back together, now you'll never know I was there..

##### <span>02.</span> Interests

1. Visuals -  I think in pictures. Whether it's films, comics, or art, they're like soul food for me.
3. Problems - A world without problems? Boring! Problems are my morning coffee; they get my blood pumping. I live to solve. The quickest way to my heart is saying, "I've got a problem."
4. Creation - I adore making things out of thin air, just to admire and think, "Yep, this is good." Classic God's-image stuff.

##### <span>03.</span> Getting into Programming

It was that `<h1>` tag that hooked me – instant gratification, love at first code. I wrote that "hello world" in HTML, and suddenly, I knew what I wanted to do. My world expanded into infinite possibilities. I could build anything I dreamed of. I was ignited, and ever since, I've been burning bright, solving problems with lines of code.

##### <span>03.</span> The Road Ahead

Now that I can craft stunning websites like this one, I want to use my skills for good. I aim to tackle everyday problems, one commit at a time. I want to revolutionize education in my country, helping kids discover their passions earlier than I did. I want to assist businesses in growing, competing, thriving. In short, I want to help people.

> I'm on the lookout for a role in web app development, preferably working with JSX/TSX, JavaScript, or Typescript. I'm especially keen on a fast-paced environment where I can make an impact swiftly. If you're hiring, let's have a chat – it could be the beginning of something awesome!
